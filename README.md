#Tackling Food Wastage
#This README provides an overview of the strategies employed to tackle food wastage in a mess environment, focusing on the implementation of the (Q,r) inventory model and the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) formula. These strategies led to a 30% reduction in daily rice wastage, streamlined procurement and storage processes, and significant cost savings. By optimizing order quantities and reorder points, we achieved a $7,000 annual expense reduction and saved $500 monthly in disposal and spoilage management.
